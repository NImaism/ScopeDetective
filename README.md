ScopeDetective is a rapid tool for monitoring scope changes on HackerOne. It provides a simple and efficient way to track modifications to the scope of your bug bounty program. By using ScopeDetective, you can stay up-to-date with any changes and ensure that you are aware of all the assets in scope.


## Features

## Usage
